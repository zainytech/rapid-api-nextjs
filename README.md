# 🤠Next.js API Routes: Advanced Data Fetching and Filtering

This project delves deeper into Next.js API routes, focusing on fetching and manipulating large datasets from external APIs. It builds upon the foundation of the previous project of api-play-nextjs, demonstrating advanced techniques for data handling and filtering.

## 👀Project Focus

* **Coinranking API Integration:** This project utilizes the Coinranking API (Rapid API) to fetch extensive cryptocurrency data.
* **Large Data Handling:** Explore strategies for managing and processing large data structures obtained from APIs.
* **Data Filtering:** Implement functionalities to filter fetched data based on user-specified criteria, displaying only relevant information on the screen.

## 📖Learning Outcomes

* **Fetching Large Datasets:** Understand techniques for efficiently fetching and handling large amounts of data from APIs in Next.js.
* **Data Object and Array Management:** Gain experience in working with complex data structures like objects and arrays returned by APIs.
* **Filtering Techniques:** Learn how to apply filters on fetched data to tailor the displayed information to user preferences.

## 🆕Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure your Rapid API key for Coinranking API access by subscribing to it (refer to their documentation).
4. Run the development server with `npm run dev`.
5. Explore the code and experiment with filtering functionalities (if implemented).

## ♟️Conclusion

By working with this project, you'll enhance your skills in handling large datasets fetched through Next.js API routes. You'll gain valuable experience in filtering and manipulating data to create dynamic and user-friendly experiences within your Next.js applications.
